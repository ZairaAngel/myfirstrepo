 Git & GitHub – Version Control
Used to track code changes, collaborate, and sync with GitHub.

Common Git Commands:
git init                            # Start a new Git repo
git clone <repo-url>                # Copy a repo from GitHub
git status                          # Check changes
git add <file> or git add .         # Stage files
git commit -m "message"             # Save snapshot
git push origin main                # Upload to GitHub
git pull origin main                # Get latest from GitHub

Commit Message Tips:
Use present tense:
✅ Add README
❌ Added README

Be specific: Fix bug in login.js, Update styles in header.css

✅ Linux Basics – Terminal + Permissions
File System Commands:
pwd            # Show current directory
ls             # List files
cd <dir>       # Change directory
mkdir <dir>    # Make new folder
touch <file>   # Create new file
rm <file>      # Delete file
mv <a> <b>     # Move or rename
cat <file>     # Show file contents
nano <file>    # Edit file

Permissions:
View: ls -l

Change permissions:
chmod u+x file.sh     # Add execute to user
chmod g-w file.txt    # Remove write from group
chmod o+r file.txt    # Add read for others

Permission format: -rwxr-xr--
u = user, g = group, o = others

✅ Networking Basics
Key Concepts:

IP Address: Unique address for each device on a network

Port: Channel to communicate with specific services (e.g., port 80 = HTTP)

DNS: Translates domain names to IP (e.g., google.com → 142.250.72.14)

Firewall: Controls traffic in/out of a system

Useful Commands:
ipconfig / ifconfig         # Show network info
ping <website.com>          # Check connectivity
nslookup <domain>           # Get DNS info
netstat -an                 # Show open ports

✅ Must-Know Summary
✔ Know how to:

Push & pull code using Git

Use terminal for navigation and file editing

Change file permissions and understand chmod

Understand IPs, ports, DNS, firewalls conceptually
